## 🌍 Overview

**LinkID** (`lid:`) is a proposal for a **W3C/IETF standard** to provide *never-break* identifiers on the Web.  
It complements existing systems (DOI, ARK, Handle) but is designed for general use across documents, websites, and archives.

- Stable IDs even if resources move or change
- Resolver algorithm with semantic/AI support
- HTTP-based form (`https://w3id.org/linkid/...`) and optional `lid:` scheme
- Open ecosystem: reference resolvers, client SDKs, tests

## 📖 Explainer

We maintain a short, human-readable **[Explainer document](docs/explainer.md)**  
that introduces the motivation, goals, and design of **LinkID**.  

If you are new to this project, start there 👉 it explains **why LinkID matters**  
and how it complements existing persistent identifier systems like DOI, ARK, or Handle.

## 📄 IETF Draft

The current Internet-Draft for the proposed `lid:` URI scheme is
maintained in [`/draft/draft-linkgenetic-lid-uri-00.md`](draft/draft-linkgenetic-lid-uri-00.md).

You can also convert it using [IETF Author Tools](https://author-tools.ietf.org/).

This folder contains Internet-Draft source files for the proposed
`lid:` URI scheme.

## Why does the header look strange?

The draft files (e.g. `draft-linkgenetic-lid-uri-00.md`) use a
**YAML front-matter header** (`--- ... ---`) that is required by the
IETF [kramdown-rfc](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc) toolchain.

- On **GitHub**, this header is not recognized and is displayed like a
  Markdown table.
- This is expected and does **not** mean the draft is broken.
- The draft is valid for the [IETF Author Tools](https://author-tools.ietf.org/).

## How to render the draft

You can generate `.txt` (official format), `.xml`, and `.html` versions
from the Markdown source:

### Option A: Online
- Upload the `.md` file to [IETF Author Tools](https://author-tools.ietf.org/).

### Option B: Local build

pip install xml2rfc
xml2rfc draft-linkgenetic-lid-uri-00.md --text --html

## 🚀 Implementations

Reference resolvers:
- [`resolver/java`](resolver/java) — Java-based reference implementation
- [`resolver/node`](resolver/node) — Node.js prototype
- [`resolver/python`](resolver/python) — FastAPI prototype

Client SDKs:
- [`sdk/js`](sdk/js) — JavaScript client
- [`sdk/java`](sdk/java) — Java client
- [`sdk/python`](sdk/python) — Python client

---

## 🧪 Tests

Tests live under [`/tests`](tests/).  
We aim to provide **two independent implementations** and **Web Platform Tests (WPT)** for conformance.
